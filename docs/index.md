## Concepts

The [purpose](/concepts/testing-purpose.md) of testing is to measure and maximise quality delivered, while minimising risk to an acceptable level. Testing [is not](/concepts/what-testing-is-not.md) straightforward. Testing [is](/concepts/what-testing-is.md) investigation, exploration, empathy, communication, and [it's not](/concepts/what-testing-is-not.md) limited to checking or automation.

As a tester, it will be your [responsibility](/concepts/tester-responsibilities.md) to be a guiding light, an inspector, a scout, a thinker, a bug detector, a (user) friend, a teammate and... a learner â€” and that I know you are, since you're reading this :)

Stakeholders use or are affected by the product you are testing. You will clarify and detail their expectations into [requirements](/concepts/requirements.md). By advocating for [testability](/concepts/testability.md), you make testing less painful and more valuable for everyone involved.
