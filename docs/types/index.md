# Test types

<!--
### Unit vs Acceptance

> Unit tests are written by programmers, using a programming language, to ensure that the code does what they intend it to do. Acceptance tests are written by business people (and QA), using an almost natural language, to make sure the code does what they intend it to do.
>
> It's true that the two streams of tests test the same things. Indeed, that's the point. The two together make sure that the business and programmers intend the same thing.
