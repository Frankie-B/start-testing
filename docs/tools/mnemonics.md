# Mnemonics

> **tl;dr** SUMMARY_HERE

## Theory

> A mnemonic is a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations which helps remember something else. It is a learning technique that aids information retention and retrieval. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic)

## Practice

- When using [Specification By Example](/notebook/specification-by-example) to write features and scenarios: **`OOPSI`** by [Jenny Martin](https://jennyjmar.com/2016/04/16/bdd-discovery-and-oopsi/)
  - Outcomes: what you expect to achieve (e.g. _As a ... I want to ... So that ..._)
  - Outputs: the outputs that deliver what you want to achieve
  - Processes: the activities performed to generate those outputs
  - Scenarios: step by step descriptions of those activities (aka. test cases)
  - Inputs: data used by scenarios to perform an activity (aka. test conditions)
