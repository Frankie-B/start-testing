# Note taking

> **tl;dr** SUMMARY_HERE

## Theory

We testers discover, gather and share information. 

If we keep that info only in our head, we are not helping the rest of the team, also we might forget! Keeping that information only in our head is both ephemeral and suboptimal.



## Practice

### üë©‚Äçüíºüë®‚Äçüíº Meetings

You might find yourself in a meeting on behalf of your team. This often happens on mettings where your team doesn't make decisions, but needs to give information or take questions. You save them time and they expect a summary of the meeting. When taking notes in meetings focus on:

- **Facts**

  - *e.g. Ann was chosen as spokesperson for the design team*

- **Issues**
  - *e.g. Devs are blocked waiting for design mockups*

- **Decisions**
  - *e.g. Devs will focus on Epic 12 while they wait for 34's designs*

- **To do**

  - *e.g. Ask Ann: What's the progress on mockups? Is there a draft devs can use in the meantime?*

- **To clarify**
- *e.g. When are regression tests executed? Ask Gary or `#regressions` Slack channel*

Note taking is also useful to reduce rambling during meetings. Share your screen while you're taking notes and use the structure above to guide the conversation. This helps everyone visualise the topics of discussion and at the end of the meeting you'll have a summary for free.

> Tip: This [website](https://shoulditbeameeting.com/#/) let's you quickly decide if you really need that meeting. You can print the [flowchart](https://dannyroosevelt.com/ratethatmeeting-assets/should-it-be-a-meeting-flowchart.pdf) too. If your team has trouble ending meetings on time, you can use this [website](https://costie.io/) to show how much that meeting is currently costing.

### üß≠ Exploratory sessions

> TO EDIT: INTRO
>
> James and Jon Bach developed [Session-Based Test Management](http://www.satisfice.com/sbtm/) (SBTM) as a method for measuring and managing exploratory testing. 
>
> Exploratory testing is learning. Learning what is and what might be. Learning about our perception of the world, what's in front of us and how that influences the choices we make. It's learning together to build better products. It's creating an environment that enables a continuous "testing is learning" loop.
>
> The [following template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rKYmujVhUlNgfeYIBot12Z8E7S0Y_Z4pk5pefK7xO3g/edit?usp=sharing) provides triggers for an exploratory testing session. It's a way for you to experiment with your own structure. To help you tell a testing story ‚Äì whether debriefing in real-time or asynchronously. I‚Äôve had success with this template. It satisfies two audiences: One that just needs a summary and another who loves detail.
>
> I take notes like I'm creating a story for someone else to read. This includes a bit of show and tell. Great storytelling uses show more than tell. Sometimes it feels more natural to *tell* your notes what you‚Äôre doing. The *show* comes alive with screenshots, GIFs and video.
>
> As I explore I write notes imagining I'm taking someone through my actual process, steps and thoughts. Imagine saying it out loud and just type. ‚Ä™You can always edit later.

#### Prepare your TORCH

- Time: XXX.
- Oracles: XXX.
- ...

```
Think TORCH. Timer, Oracles, Risks, Consider, Heuristics.
Timer
How much time will you put aside for this session? 45 minutes, an hour and a half? Consider a sweet spot between a good enough amount of time to capture and share information that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm your audience. My preference is for 60 minutes max.
Oracles
Who and what will help you make useful decisions and conclusions about the information you discover? A person, a story in JIRA, previous experience, a comparable product in the market? Katrina Clokie shares useful info on Oracles. 
Risks
What risks would you like to learn about? Are they related to data, performance, security, functionality? Mark Winteringham and Dan Ashby share some thoughts in this handy video. 
Consider
What questions do you want to explore? Try asking at least one question starting with ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù ‚ÄúWho‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow‚Äù.
Heuristics
What triggers will prompt you during your session? The Heuristics Cheat Sheet and TestSphere are incredible resources.
```

#### KIIQ exploring

I group discoveries into four categories: Issues, Questions, Ideas and Praise (PQIP).

- Kudos
- Ideas
- Issues
- Questions

#### Bring PROOF

In addition to walking through the session sheet, we use an agenda summarized by the acronym ‚ÄúPROOF‚Äù:

- Past What happened during the session?
- Results What was achieved during the session?
- Obstacles What got in the way of good testing?
- Outlook What still needs to be done?
- Feelings How does the tester feel about all this?
