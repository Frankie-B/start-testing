# Note-taking

> **tl;dr** SUMMARY_HERE

## Theory

We testers discover, gather and share information.

Keeping that information only inside your head is both ephemeral and ineffective. What you discover is of little use if you cannot communicate that information to the right audience, in a clear and engaging format.

When we recall things we often miss important details or we remember them in a way that reinforces our own thinking ([confirmation bias](/tools/biases.md)). Writing notes frequently during your testing sessions reduces this risk.

Moreover, note-taking is a skill that greatly improves your exploratory testing by giving it structure. Good exploratory testing debriefs are insightful, searchable, and repeatable.

Find your own way of supporting your memory and your ability to explain what you tested — there are many tools and processes at your disposal.

## Practice

### 👩‍💼👨‍💼 Meetings

You might find yourself in a meeting on behalf of your team. This often happens on mettings where your team doesn't make decisions, but needs to give information or take questions. You save them time and they expect a summary of the meeting. When taking notes in meetings focus on:

- **Facts**

  - *e.g. Ann was chosen as spokesperson for the design team*

- **Issues**
  - *e.g. Devs are blocked waiting for design mockups*

- **Decisions**
  - *e.g. Devs will focus on Epic 12 while they wait for 34's designs*

- **To do**

  - *e.g. Ask Ann: What's the progress on mockups? Is there a draft devs can use in the meantime?*

- **To clarify**
  - *e.g. When are regression tests executed? Ask Gary or `#regressions` Slack channel*

Note taking is also useful to reduce rambling during meetings. Share your screen while you're taking notes and use the structure above to guide the conversation. This helps everyone visualise the topics of discussion and at the end of the meeting you'll have a summary for free.

You can print the [flowchart](https://dannyroosevelt.com/ratethatmeeting-assets/should-it-be-a-meeting-flowchart.pdf) too. If your team has trouble ending meetings on time, you can use this [website](https://costie.io/) to show how much that meeting is currently costing.

### 🧭 Exploratory sessions

> TO EDIT: INTRO
>
> James and Jon Bach developed [Session-Based Test Management](http://www.satisfice.com/sbtm/) (SBTM) as a method for measuring and managing exploratory testing. 
>
> Exploratory testing is learning. Learning what is and what might be. Learning about our perception of the world, what's in front of us and how that influences the choices we make. It's learning together to build better products. It's creating an environment that enables a continuous "testing is learning" loop.

> The [following template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rKYmujVhUlNgfeYIBot12Z8E7S0Y_Z4pk5pefK7xO3g/edit?usp=sharing) provides triggers for an exploratory testing session. It's a way for you to experiment with your own structure. To help you tell a testing story – whether debriefing in real-time or asynchronously. I’ve had success with this template. It satisfies two audiences: One that just needs a summary and another who loves detail.
>
> I take notes like I'm creating a story for someone else to read. This includes a bit of show and tell. Great storytelling uses show more than tell. Sometimes it feels more natural to *tell* your notes what you’re doing. The *show* comes alive with screenshots, GIFs and video.
>
> As I explore I write notes imagining I'm taking someone through my actual process, steps and thoughts. Imagine saying it out loud and just type. ‪You can always edit later.

### User testing

It's important to note that we 

always

 work on user tests in pairs; one moderator and one observer. The observer's notes are typically more useful and detailed than the moderator's whose main task is guiding participant through the site and exposing relevant issues. That said, at Webcredible both the moderator and observer take notes when we run user testing. Mostly quotes from participants which helps a lot with writing the report and producing a highlight video afterwards. We often write down the time stamp if it's a really good quote to find it easily in the recording. In addition to what the participants say and do, we also write down immediately apparent solutions and recommendations. These might not always be the right solutions but it's the start of the problem solving process and important to do.

### How do we make sure the notes are useful?

- Organise the notes by participant and then again into themes
- Use shorthand or even sketches for quick scribbling
- Take a lot of notes in the first few sessions and use the following sessions to collect evidence for recurring issues
- Note down timestamps for recurring issues and good quotes
- Start with a list of tasks as section headings and write the notes under each task

### How do we use the notes after the tests?

There are some common steps we all go through. First, we go through the notes to categorise the information by participants and task. Secondly, we analyse the findings, either by comparing notes from differing sessions and finding the common issues or extracting the key points. Lastly, we use the notes as a reference during writing reports or debriefing with the clients. There are endless ways for taking notes in user testing sessions. It's important to try out different methods and find what works for you and the project at hand. For the moment, I have settled with Evernote on my iPad and highlighting the most important points after each session. If you want to learn more about user testing, we have a training course 

dedicated to the subject

. User testing is also one of our 

core services

 as a consultancy, so if you don't feel up to the task, get us involved!
