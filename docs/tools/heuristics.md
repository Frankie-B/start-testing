# Heuristics

> **tl;dr** SUMMARY_HERE

## Theory

If [mnemonics]() act as "memory shortcuts", then heuristics are "decision shortcuts".

> We use heuristics under conditions of uncertainty (...) to rapidly solve problems and make decisions. When you consider the vast number of decisions people make on a daily basis, it makes a lot of sense for our brains to use shortcuts to help us quickly assess the different options and decide.

Here is an example of a heuristics that you might recall from your student years: "I don't know the contents of the next exam, but the teacher already mentioned this subject three times, so it must be important."

This example heuristic is useful for demonstrating two other key characteristics of heuristics: 

- **All heuristics are fallible**. Under the availability heuristic, people tend to make decisions based on more recent information that is quickly called to mind and the solution you remember easily might not be the optimal solution. 
- **The unknowing use of any heuristic can lead to systematic errors in thinking known as biases**. Biases can have a detrimental impact on you and your testing. For example, under the availability heuristic, if you used a tool successfully in your last few projects, you might want to use it in the next even when there are more suitable tools available.

> Despite their fallible nature and the potential biases they cause, heuristics are very useful. It may be impossible or impractical to find the optimal solution to a problem. In these circumstances, we can use heuristics to find solutions that are ‘good enough’ to achieve our immediate goal.
>
> The use and development of heuristics are considered to be innate. Some are believed to be “hard-coded” into our brains, serving as adaptive survival mechanisms. 
>
> Humans employ and develop them every day whenever we quickly make judgments or reach decisions without using all information or computational abilities available to us. Some examples of everyday heuristic techniques that you may recognise are using a rule of thumb, making an educated guess, or following your intuition. Without such heuristics, we’d be unable to function effectively; everyday decisions and judgments would require an exhaustive cost-benefit analysis.
>
> The degree to which we use certain heuristics changes based on our experiences, abilities and skills. This highlights another important aspect of heuristics; we naturally tend to develop and use heuristics in contexts where we have experience of them being successful and avoid using heuristics that have been less successful.
>
> If we have an understanding of common heuristics, the potential biases they cause and have experience of using them in various contexts, we can knowingly and wisely choose the most appropriate heuristic to solve our immediate problem.



## Practice

> Heuristics can work incredibly well in certain contexts when applied with thought and skill.
>
> As testers, we frequently come across heuristics in the form of checklists, mnemonics and cheat sheets. They may sometimes be referred to as oracles or models. No matter what they're called or the form you get them in, if they serve as cognitive shortcuts that help us to solve problems or make decisions, they’re heuristics.

>
>   When considering the Goldilocks heuristic, testers could think about data entry fields and try testing with data entries that are too big, too small and with entries that are more “typical” for that field and context. For example, you could try entering data into a currency field with a googol, a negative number and a more typical number for your product.

>
> Once you’ve learnt all about heuristics, it’s time to practice applying them in different contexts. Importantly, you should reflect upon their efficacy; what worked, what didn’t and why. If a heuristic is not working for you, try another, modify it or make your own.
