# Charters

## Theory

...

- Charters are a small sentence that focus an exploratory testing session


- Each charter is based on a risk that has been identified within a specific area that has to be focused on

Charters can be precise or broad, as you will see in the [practice section](#practice).

- Gives much more structure to an exploratory tester in revealing information for a specific risk.


- Allows an exploratory tester to determine whether they are going off charter and determine if that is acceptable.
- Groups of charters can help define the body of work for a tester to carry out on a user story or a feature.

dangers

- charters need to be just the right level of abstract and specific to allow a tester space to explore but not get lost in their exploration
- Skills are required in identifying risks to help determine risks
- charters are fallible in that they focus on a specific risk, missing charters can affect your level of coverage.

## Practice

As mentioned, charters can be precise or broad. If you are testing a specific area of your product for the first time, maybe you don't have enough knowledge to write a detailed charter. In that case your testing charter might look like this:

>  My mission is to test **the user interface** to discover **accessibility issues**.

As you continue to test other parts of your product, you start to narrow down what still needs further testing. This time the charter for your next test session can be more focused and detailed:

> Explore **the login form** using **different credentials** to discover **how secure the form is**.

In this last charter you clearly specify your target (the login form) and what is your goal (to discover how secure the form is). You also have a strategy on how you will explore your target to get the information you want (using different credentials).

Notice that "different credentials" is still a bit vague, however we want to keep charters **concise and jargon-free**. That's enough for any non-technical reader to understand the type of testing you carried out on your session.

The next time you need to come up with testing charters you can use templates to speed up the process. These **charter templates** give you a framework and you only need to fill in the gaps. Based on the previous examples, we can design these two templates:

> Explore **target**
> With **resource**
> To discover **information**

> My mission is to test **target**
> To discover **information**

Remember, these templates are tools not rules. Feel free to create your own templates and don't let them limit your creativity.
