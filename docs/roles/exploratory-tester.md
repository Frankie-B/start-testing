> Exploratory testing is learning. Learning what is and what might be. Learning about our perception of the world, what's in front of us and how that influences the choices we make. It's learning together to build better products. It's creating an environment that enables a continuous "testing is learning" loop.

It's a way for you to experiment with your own structure. To help you tell a testing story ‚Äì whether debriefing in real-time or asynchronously. I‚Äôve had success with this template. It satisfies two audiences: One that just needs a summary and another who loves detail.

#### Prepare your TORCH

These questions will structure and guide your exploratory testing session:

- Time: How much time will you put aside for this session? _(aim for 45-60 mins)_
- Oracles: Who or what will help you act on the information you discover? (see [oracles](/tools/oracles.md))
- Risks: What do you want to learn about? (see [charters](/tools/charters.md))
- Consider: What questions do you want to answer? (see [**`5W1H`** mnemonic](/tools/mnemonics.md))
- Heuristics: What triggers will guide your session? (see [heuristics](/tools/heuristics.md))

#### KIIQ exploring

I group discoveries into four categories: Issues, Questions, Ideas and Praise (PQIP).

- Kudos
- Ideas
- Issues
- Questions

#### Bring PROOF

In addition to walking through the session sheet, we use an agenda summarized by the acronym ‚ÄúPROOF‚Äù:

- Past: What happened during the session?
- Results: What was achieved during the session?
- Obstacles: What got in the way of good testing?
- Outlook: What still needs to be done?
- Feelings: How does the tester feel about all this?
