# Testing's purpose

> **tl;dr** SUMMARY_HERE

## Theory

Are you looking for the official definition of testing? You won't like it. Fine, here it is:

> The process consisting of all lifecycle activities, both static and dynamic, concerned with planning, preparation and evaluation of software products and related work products to determine that they satisfy specified requirements, to demonstrate that they are fit for purpose and to detect defects.
>
> — International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB)

You just read 43 words in a single sentence. [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) hates it and your brain hates it too. Instead, let's focus on **what is the purpose of testing** — why we need it and what it is. From there, we can think about the [responsibilities of a tester](/concepts/responsibilities.md).

### Quality pursuit

Quality is **value to some person, who matters**. A bug is anything that threatens quality. This simple definition shows how subjective quality really is. Here are a few other perspectives:

- Aesthetic view: *Quality is emotive and simplicity.*
  - ✅ Fosters excellence and pride in workmanship.
  - ❌ Can become a cloak for perfectionists.
- Manufacturing view: *Quality is conformance to specifications.*
  - ✅ Fits mindset of highly regulated contexts, e.g. health industry.
  - ❌ Can produce products that satisfy no one, besides the specification author.
- Customer view: *Quality is whatever satisfies the customer.*
  - ✅ Increased customer loyalty.
  - ❌ Always behind, chasing trends and competitors.


Stakeholders will form a perception of the current quality based on their values, knowledge, skills and past experiences. Given the diversity of stakeholders, each will have a different perception of quality. That's why you cannot _assure quality_ to all of them. Acknowledge that while you cannot guarantee it you can do your best effort to pursuit it.

Therefore the **purpose of testing** is measure and maximise quality delivered.

### What testing is

- **Zero quality control**. Quality is built-in and it is not a separate/dedicated stage in the process.
- **Quick feedback**. Identify issues early when they are the cheapest to fix.

> Testing is identifying the subtleties and extremities where the system can be used.
>
> Testing is to provide the consumer with an application which re-ensures confidence in the consumer and for the business.
>
> Testing is to continuously collect aids which aims at delivering quality information to anyone equipped to better build the product.
>
> Testing is to act in unison with the vision and mission of the product.
>
> Testing is having an eye for details however miniature or magnanimous.
>
> Testing is questioning, challenging, being biased and up-rooting the biases about how the product is presumed to be built and used.
>
> Testing is buying yourself a microscope and a telescope to look at how a product is consumed today and in future.
>
> Testing is testing the assumptions, re-opening a concluded case, change perspective.
>
> Testing is diminishing confusion and expanding the confidence of a user.
>
> Testing is closing in on the ‘I’ the consumer, ‘I’ the tester, ‘I’ the developer, ‘I’ the owner and illuminating the path of ‘We’ the team.


>  Helicopter view: it is sufficiently open that people could buy into it, and read into it, particularly non-testers.
>
>  "pursuit" two aspects of testing for me: finding out what is there and digging what needs to be uncovered (chasing something which might be elusive or hard to find/spot).
>
>  Finding what is Not in harmony with the surroundings (context)
>
>  Testing is making implicit things explicit to someone who matters. What everyone looks at but no one sees.

### What testing is not

> There is a powerful alternative to the orthodox, expensive, and boring methodologies that aim at
> the best possible quality: (…) the discipline of good enough software development. — [James Bach](http://www.satisfice.com/articles/gooden2.pdf)

**Quality Assurance (QA)**: Ah, yes. The most abused title/phrase in the testing world…No one person does this, and anyone who has a title “QA” is fooling themselves. “The quality assurance role in the company resides with the management and the CEO (the principal quality officer in the company), since it was they—and certainly not the testers—who had the authority to make decisions about quality.”
