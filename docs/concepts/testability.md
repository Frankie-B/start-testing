# Testability

> **tl;dr** SUMMARY_HERE

## Theory

Testability measures our ability to test -- how skilled we are, how easy it is to test, and how deep we can go.

## Practice

There are ~~boring~~ ~~expensive~~ formal [maturity models](https://www.tmmi.org/tmmi-documents/#) in the market to evaluate your testability. If you prefer something simple and tailored to your team, you can use the [Test Improvement Assessment](http://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Test-Improvement-Huib-Schoots-Joep-Schuurkes.pdf) instead. Essentially your team selects which testability criteria are relevant for your context, scores them and then agrees on ways to improve.
