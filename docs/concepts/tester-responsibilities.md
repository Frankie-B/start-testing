# Tester's responsibilities

> **tl;dr** To perform the necessary activities to fulfil the [purpose of testing](/concepts/testing-purpose.md).

## Theory

Your responsibility as a tester is to fulfil the [purpose of testing](/concepts/testing-purpose.md).

That means you will be performing a [diverse set of activities](/concepts/what-testing-is.md), which include:

- Clarify [requirements](/concepts/requirements.md) between stakeholders and developers;
- Elaborate a [test strategy]() for your product;
- Advocate the right [test methodology]() for your team;
- Collect and develop [tools and techniques]() to support your testing;
- Choose which [test types]() bring the most value at a given time;
- Adapt your [role]() to the current team's needs.

While you do all that, be aware and [avoid the common pitfalls](/concepts/what-testing-is-not.md).

## Practice

ü§î Think like a tester











---------

### üîé Investigation

(blank)

- Testing is that feeling when you love yourself for learning something new every day.
- Testing is breaking barriers to testing.

### ‚õ∫Ô∏è Exploration

(blank)

- Testing is learning to explore "the road less travelled".

### ü§ù Empathy

(blank)

- Testing is an unconventional mode of transport to the minds of a user.

### üí¨ Communication

(blank)

- Testing is story telling
- Testing is building credibility for yourself and your organisation, which serves you and which you are serving.
- Testing is a responsibility of representing information which is essential for bettering the application/product under test.

## Practice

The goal of a tester is not _just_ finding issues, otherwise you might become [a perfectionist that raises mostly low-value issues](https://letmetrysoftwaretesting.wordpress.com/2018/01/22/testing-to-make-product-better-vs-perfect/). Instead, your focus should be pursuing quality and keeping it at a high level. Finding issues is just a consequence of that pursuit.

> About half my day is facilitating conversations between bizdev, design, and the founders of the company and attempting to understand what each person is expecting from a release and to help get the release into a place where all stakeholders expectations are met. If this is not possible I relay that to the stakeholder that this will affect new timelines for implementations and data analysis to say why and how.
> I attempt to increase the velocity of the engineers work by suggestion tooling, systems, and communication practices that expedite our work.
> I also investigate any client bugs which were reported

The light in the dark

Although we try to account for multiple scenarios that might come our way, It is impossible to think that there will be no trouble ahead. The tester's role is to find information along the journey so that the team is able make better decisions to reach the goal. As the tester, it is your responsibility to tell management what you feel about the project.

Verify what is being built is what has been asked

Your job is to clarify the mission, the goal. You get the team to sit down and agree with the mission objectives. Finally, if you find yourself losing track, remind yourself of your goal. This is what will keep you going. As a team member, it is one of your roles to verify if what is being built is correct. Imagine building a car without blueprints?

Find threats to the value of your product

One of our core missions - finding bugs that are important quickly. Why do this? It is the job of the tester to inform the stakeholders about anything that threatens the value of the system. They test that the core functionality still works before looking at the new functions. They test items of higher-impact before testing items of lower impact. The tester finds important problems soon and will make sure that the team knows about it.

Dealing with multiple stakeholders

- Developers - You make the programmer's job extremely clear by writing out clear acceptance criteria, clear test plans, and clear bug reports, as soon as possible. The tester needs to know the product like it's the back of their hand so you don't waste the time of the developers, your product manager, and other teams. When you know about the product, you will gain influence and credibility.
- Project Manager - The project manager needs to know your process, what you do, why you are doing it. The project manager is served by reporting the status of the testing, reporting problems fast. This information is important to the project manager as he the right to steer the project, and what you say will drive the decision.
- Technical Support -  The bugs that are still present in the system becomes a burden for the customer team or the technical support team. This group is served by alerting them of what parts of the platform maybe inhibited and if there is a workaround.
- Top management - Your role is to create reports in an extremely simple manner so that they are able to take actions into your findings. You may find that despite something has been ‚ÄúReady for QA‚Äù when you start testing in the staging server it doesn't work. What could it be? Could it be that it works on local but it does not work in the server? Whatever case you may find, you must have solutions to your problems rather than being the bearer of bad news all the time.
- The end user - Deep inside you now that you serve the one true master, the user. There is an exhilarating effect that you have the responsibility to ensure that the product works as expected. If you so much as say you are not happy with a certain feature then what you say is taken seriously. What I've found is that most of the time, the functionality works but the User Experience is not taken into account. It is the tester's duty to tell the team that if the colour of a button is not consistent with the same type of button in a different part of the system. You may ask why should you care about the colour of a button? To me, finding inconsistencies is a major issue and detrimental to the usability of the product. Who wants to use an inconsistent platform?

More about stakeholders when you get to [requirements](/concepts/requirements.md).

Don't own quality

You are not the one sole responsible for the quality of the product. Sometimes, you may find yourself not having a say with how something should be implemented and that‚Äôs fine. It is important that you make your team feel empowered that they are doing the job their own way so as to preserve their creativity. The tester does not ‚Äúbreak the product‚Äù, the tester finds a product that is already broken. You must work with the team to ensure that you keep on improving. If you find that in sprint retrospectives no one is making suggestions to improve the process, something is going terribly wrong. Be a quality fanatic, if something can be automated and would save 5 minutes a day, say it.



----------

When we have this sort of immediate feedback we learn quicker, we improve our game. When the feedback is about problems we don't even know might exist, that expands our knowledge letting us adapt before its painful to do so.

My son had his own plan, skill and will. He could have learned on his own. It probably would have taken longer and maybe been more painful or even dangerous. Working as a team, we achieved something, more than we could alone.

That's where skilled testers come in. Some of us are highly technical and will highlight technical issues or opportunities you haven't noticed. Some of us are skilled at seeing the app from the customers view point and highlighting problems that will cost you customers. Many of us do the above and much more. This could be letting you know if we are breaking the law. We often write tools that enable us to test more things ‚Äì better. Testers can be useful for just pointing out the simple stuff like ‚Äì we are developing for Red Hat Linux, but 60% of our users are on Windows, and 25% are on Apple Macs.
