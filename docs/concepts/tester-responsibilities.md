## Theory

Testers fulfil the [purpose of testing](/concepts/testing-purpose.md).

### 🔎 Investigation

- Testing is that feeling when you love yourself for learning to learn new every day.
- Testing is breaking barriers to test.

### ⛺️ Exploration

(blank)

- Testing is learning to explore "the road less travelled".

### 🤝 Empathy

- Testing is an unconventional mode of transport to the minds of a user.

### 💬 Communication

(blank)

- Testing is story telling
- Testing is building credibility for yourself and your organisation, which serves you and which you are serving.
- Testing is a responsibility of representing information which is essential for bettering the application/product under test.

> About half my day is facilitating conversations between bizdev, design, and the founders of the company and attempting to understand what each person is expecting from a release and to help get the release into a place where all stakeholders expectations are met. If this is not possible I relay that to the stakeholder that this will affect new timelines for implementations and data analysis to say why and how.
> I attempt to increase the velocity of the engineers work by suggestion tooling, systems, and communication practices that expedite our work.
> I also investigate any client bugs which were reported
