# Requirements

## Theory

What are requirements? Who writes them?

### Concepts

- Requirement:
- Specification:
- Story:
- Backlog:
- Acceptance Criteria:

### Roles

- The **Stakeholder**: Anyone that has authority to influence the specification. That authority might have different sources: they will use it (users), they will maintain it (architects), they will help users (support), they are paying for it (client).
- The **Product Owner** (PO): Discovers who are the relevant stakeholders. Gathers requirements from stakeholders. Takes decisions as a spokesman for all stakeholders.
- The **Business Analyst** (BA): Improves the specification based on his/her experience and business context, without biasing it. Can act as Product Owner.
- The "**three amigos**" are a product owner, a developer and a tester. Seems like the start of a joke, but it's really just a nickname for temporary subteam with those three roles.


## Practice

There are many ways to write the specification of a product, however there are two main approaches:

- In a **waterfall project**, the client gathers requirements from their relevant stakeholders and writes a document containing them. That document is casually referred to as "the specification" or more formally as Software Requirements Specification (SRS). Once approved, the specification does not change and the team starts implementing it.


- In an **agile project**, the PO engages in conversations with the client's stakeholders and gathers goals and requirements. The three amigos collaborate to write stories that will implement those requirements. The list of stories not yet implemented is called the backlog. The details of those stories, as well as their priority, can be changed during the project.
