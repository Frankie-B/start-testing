# Requirements

> **td;dr** WHAT_ARE_THEY. HOW_WE_HELP.

## Theory

Scope is XXX. Here are other **concepts** you should keep in mind:

- *Requirement:* Some behaviour or property required by a stakeholder to achieve a goal.
- *Specification:* The list containing all requirements for a given project/product.
- *User story:* Concise description of a requirement, told from the perspective of the stakeholder who desires it. Tipically follows the structure `As a <user>, I want to <goal> so that <motivation>`.
- *Acceptance criteria* (AC): Statements that are expected to be true if the user story is correctly implemented. If the ACs are met, the implementation is *accepted*. If there's a mismatch, either the ACs are revised or the implementation redone.
- *Backlog:* The list containing all user stories to implement for a given project/product.

These are the **main roles** that engage in breaking down a product into requirements:

- The *Stakeholder:* Anyone that has authority to influence the specification. They might have that power because: they will use it (users); they will maintain it (architects); they will help users (support); they are paying for it (client).
- The *Product Owner* (PO): Discovers who are the relevant stakeholders. Gathers requirements from stakeholders. Takes decisions as a spokesman for all stakeholders.
- The *Business Analyst* (BA): Improves the specification based on his/her experience and business context, without biasing it. Can act as Product Owner.
- The *"three amigos"* are a product owner, a developer and a tester. Seems like the start of a joke, but it is really just a nickname for temporary subteam with those three roles.

There are several **ways to write the specification** of a product, however there are two main approaches:

- In a *waterfall project*, the client gathers requirements from their relevant stakeholders and writes a document containing them. That document is casually referred to as "the specification" or more formally as Software Requirements Specification (SRS). Once approved, the specification does not change and the team starts implementing it.


- In an *agile project*, the PO engages in conversations with the client's stakeholders and gathers their goals and requirements. The three amigos collaborate to write user stories that will implement those requirements. The list of stories not yet implemented is called the backlog. The details of those stories, as well as their priority, can be changed during the project.

## Practice

There's one question that remains: **How can testers add value to this process?**

> Building the right thing (business) meeting the client's expectations or requirements - Will it be useful?
>
> Building it right (tech) using the correct tools, tech, arch, practices - Will it work?
