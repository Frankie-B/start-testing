# Test strategy

> **tl;dr** SUMMARY_HERE

## Theory



> identify key areas to focus testing on. They’re an excellent analytical tool, challenging you to think about assumptions, constraints and resources. they can be used as a communication tool to justify budget in terms of people and resources.
>
> An emergent strategy (...) emerges as assumptions get tested, constraints become concrete and context changes. When you begin testing and discover a whole new set of risks you hadn’t realised before and change direction to accomodate that.
>
> When working in complex, uncertain environments, when there’s more questions than answers, it makes sense for teams to be aware of the emergent nature of a software testing strategy.
>
> MY THOUGHTS: it's like exploratory testing, the plan gives you structure but doesn't limit you, you learn and adapt as you go.
