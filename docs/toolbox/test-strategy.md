# Test strategy

> **tl;dr** SUMMARY_HERE

## Theory

> Creating a test plan is complex. An ideal test plan is accomplished by applying [cost-benefit analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost–benefit_analysis) and [risk analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_analysis), optimally balancing these software development factors: implementation cost, maintenance cost, monetary cost, benefit, risk.
>
> It does not provide a test plan template, because templates are often too generic or too specific and quickly become outdated. Instead, it focuses on selecting the best content when writing a test plan.

> Search for 'How to write a test plan' on the internet and there are all sorts of templates, 'must haves', tutorials and lots more. Once it's written, reviewed, edited, finalised, and distributed to all the relevant stakeholders, it's quite common to find out later than almost no-one has actually read it.
>
> A test plan may also be used as a 'shield' of sorts.  If something goes wrong, it could be necessary to refer back to the test plan document, to find missed scope, lack of test coverage, or to see what the agreed scope of testing was. In a regulated or very controlled environment it could be a mandatory part of the testing cycle, a legal requirement even, or a deliverable of the project. 
>
> MY THOUGHTS: when you do Agile, this is not usually the case. Refer to agile manifesto.
>
> Writing down what you plan to do can assist you in organising your thoughts.
>
> Lacking a written test plan doesn't mean a plan does not exist. Sometimes test plans could be very simple mission statements or mind maps with workflows. Do what suits the business needs best.
>
> For everything you decide to add to your document, ask yourself, 'Does the reader need to know this?', 'Is this information that matters?'. In addition, as mentioned previously, ask the reader! What do they want to know from the plan?

> - Scope
> - Risks
> - Assumptions
> - Tools
> - Environments
> - People & Time

> Every time I look at any of the dozens of test plans my teams have written, I see dead test plans. This begs the question: if a plan isn’t worth bothering to update, is it worth creating in the first place?
>
> If test plans have any value at all then let’s get to that value as quickly as possible. Write a test plan in 10 minutes. They had 80% of the work complete in 30 minutes.

> identify key areas to focus testing on. They’re an excellent analytical tool, challenging you to think about assumptions, constraints and resources. they can be used as a communication tool to justify budget in terms of people and resources.
>
> An emergent strategy (...) emerges as assumptions get tested, constraints become concrete and context changes. When you begin testing and discover a whole new set of risks you hadn’t realised before and change direction to accomodate that.
>
> When working in complex, uncertain environments, when there’s more questions than answers, it makes sense for teams to be aware of the emergent nature of a software testing strategy.
>
> MY THOUGHTS: it's like exploratory testing, the plan gives you structure but doesn't limit you, you learn and adapt as you go.

## Practice

> - What is covered by unit (small), integration (medium), and system (large) tests?
> - What will be tested manually vs. automated?
> - What kind of testing will be done outside of your team?
> - How are builds and tests run continuously?
> - How will external users report bugs?
> - How does bug triage work?
> - Who is the test plan's audience?
