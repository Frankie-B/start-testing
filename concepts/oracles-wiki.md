# Oracles

## Theory

**An oracle is a source of knowledge** that improves your testing. With the information it provides you can better decide and justify if something is a defect or not.

Some oracles lead you to other oracles, which allows you to extend your initial test strategy into areas you haven't thought about before. Keep in mind that **each oracle focus on a specific perspective**. If you limit yourself to a single oracle, it might bias your testing by giving you a narrow view of your context.

In **oracle-based testing**, you compare the behavior of the program under test to the behavior of a source you consider accurate (an oracle). You constantly look for answers to: Is this behavior correct? In the user expecting this? A tester who is familiar with the type of product under test will have no problem making these evaluations. However, a newcomer needs a reference for guidance â€” an oracle.

## Practice

Here's a list of oracles you can use to aid your testing. The [mnemonic](#) to remember them is FEW HICCUPS:

- F
- E
- W
- H
- I
- C
- C
- U
- P
- S
