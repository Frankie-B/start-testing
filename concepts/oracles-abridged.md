# Oracles

## Articles

> An oracle is a source of knowledge that informs your testing. That information helps you determine if something is a defect or not. Oracles can be used to justify your bugs reports and inform your test strategy and prioritisation.

> In Oracle-based testing, we compare the behavior of the program under test to the behavior of a source we consider accurate (an oracle). We look for answers to: Is this behavior correct? In line with user expectations? A tester who is expert with this type of product will have no problem making these evaluations, but a newcomer needs a reference for guidance. An oracle is one such reference.
