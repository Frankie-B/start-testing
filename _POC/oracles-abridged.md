# Oracles

## Articles

> An oracle is a source of knowledge that informs your testing. That information helps you determine if something is a defect or not. Oracles can be used to justify your bugs reports and inform your test strategy and prioritisation.

> An oracle is a mechanism for determining whether the program has passed or failed a test.

> In Oracle-based testing, we compare the behavior of the program under test to the behavior of a source we consider accurate (an oracle). We look for answers to: Is this behavior correct? In line with user expectations? A tester who is expert with this type of product will have no problem making these evaluations, but a newcomer needs a reference for guidance. An oracle is one such reference.

> There are a number of ways in which I might determine that I have discovered a bug in a software application. These are my test oracles. Oracles are the mechanism by which we recognise a problem.
>
> When I find a bug during my testing I always consider why I think that I have found a bug. I don't like to cite my "gut feeling". Oracles help me to discover the real reason that I think there is a problem.

> A test involved comparison of the test result to an expected result. The expected result was the oracle: the thing that would tell you whether the program passed or failed the test. Oracles are heuristics — they are useful tools that help us make decisions, but sometimes they point us to the wrong decision.

> Given that an oracle is incomplete, you might use the oracle and incorrectly conclude that the program failed the test when it didn’t or vice-versa. Either way, reliance on an oracle can lead you to the wrong conclusion. A decision rule that is useful but not always correct is called a heuristic.

> An oracle might be:
>
> - a document, that gives specific correct outputs for specific given inputs;
> - an algorithm, that a human could manually use to calculate correct outputs for given inputs;
> - another program, which takes the same input and produces the same output (for comparison);
> - a human domain expert, who can look at the output and tell whether it is correct;
> - or any other way of telling that a given output is correct.
>
> Some oracles do not specify concrete output values, only constraints or rules.
